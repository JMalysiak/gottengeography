Translating GottenGeography:

1. Create a new po file with msginit:

$ cd po/
$ msginit --input=gottengeography.pot --locale=[language]

(where [language] is something like en_GB or zh_CN)

2. Edit [language].po with the translations correct for your language.

3. Compile it:

$ msgfmt [language].po -o gottengeography.mo

4. Install it

$ sudo mv gottengeography.mo /usr/share/locale/[language]/LC_MESSAGES/

5. Run it!

$ cd ..
$ LANG=[language].utf8 ./gottengeography.py

And you should see your translation appear!

6. Send the [language].po file to me (rbpark@exolucere.ca) and I'll include it
with future releases of GottenGeography for all to enjoy.
