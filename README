GottenGeography is a program to allow you to geotag your photos (that is,
store latitude and longitude coordinates directly into the EXIF data of
your images, so you never forget where your photos were taken.

Note that GottenGeography is currently in a highly alpha pre-release state:
it is not currently capable of either of it's two primary goals: saving data, or 
geotagging images based on timestamp comparison with GPX files.

However, in it's current state it's able to:

* display maps using libchamplain,
* parse GPX (xml) files and display the GPS tracks on the libchamplain map,
* read pre-existing geotags inside photo EXIF data using pyexiv2 and display
    markers on the libchamplain map indicating where those photos were taken
* manually geotag images (upon clicking the 'apply' button, the coordinates
    of the center of the map are attached to the selected photos)
    
You may be interested in hacking on GottenGeography if you enjoy writing Python
code, have some experience with the poorly-documented GObject Introspection
black magic, or are a huge GPS nerd like myself. 

GottenGeography is heavily inspired by the OSX application PhotoLinker.app[1],

This little project is my baby, and I'm eager to see it to completion.
